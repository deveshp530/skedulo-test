Wanted to create components for each of the following:
    SearchBar, JobList, Jobs


the search bar will call the function to connect with the service and display jobs with a matching query

the joblist takes in the data of the resulting searchterm and passes it on to the component. The joblist then takes in the prop of jobs which uses the map function to create multiple Job components based on the query.

# Improvements
I couldn't get the field to clear when the search field is empty. 

Add some CSS design
